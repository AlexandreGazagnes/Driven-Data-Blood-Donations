# Driven-Data-Blood-Donations
Blood donation has been around for a long time. The first successful recorded transfusion was between two dogs in 1665, and the first medical use of human blood in a transfusion occurred in 1818. Even today, donated blood remains a critical resource during emergencies.https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/warm-up-predict-blood-donations/
